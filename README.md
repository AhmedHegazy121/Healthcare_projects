  In this project, I analyzed Emergency Room visit data to support decision-making related to performance improvement.
 The dashboard identifies time-based visit patterns, peak hours, bottlenecks such as long wait times by department, and variations in patient satisfaction by demographic group.

  <b>🔹  Analytical Questions  🔹</b>
</p>



✅ Overall Performance:
> How many patients visited the Emergency Room this month? Has it increased or decreased compared to last month?
> 
> What is the average patient satisfaction score? Has it improved compared to the previous month?
> 
> What is the average wait time? Has it gone up or down?

✅ Time Distribution:
> Which days of the week are the busiest?
> 
> What are the peak hours during the day?
> 
> Which specific day and time experience the highest volume of visits? (Thursday at 11:00 PM)

✅ Patient Demographics:
> What is the gender distribution of patients (male vs. female)?
> 
> Which age group visits the ER the most? (Children, Adults, Seniors)

✅ Patient Satisfaction:
> How does patient satisfaction vary by race, gender, or age?
> 
> Example: White patients have the highest satisfaction (6.05), while Native American/Alaska Native patients have the lowest (4.17).

✅ Wait Time by Referral Department:
> Which department has the longest average wait time? (Answer: Neurology – 38 minutes)
> 
> Which departments need operational improvement to reduce wait times?

<h1 align="center"> 🏥 Healthcare Provider  Projects  </h1>

A collection of healthcare analytics dashboards and insights powered by **Power BI** and **DAX**.  
Focus areas include patient billing, procedure cost distribution, departmental revenue analysis, and regional performance.

<p align="center">
  <b>🔹Key Insights 🔹</b>
</p>
 

 **💰 Financial Overview**

 
- **Insurance Coverage:** ~66.7% of total healthcare costs
- **Out-of-Pocket Expenses:** ~33.3%
>  While insurance plays a dominant role in covering treatment costs,  
>  the out-of-pocket share remains a **significant financial burden** for many patients.



**🖼️ Imaging Procedure Billing**


- **Top Contributors:** X-Ray, CT Scan, MRI
- **Combined Share:** **73%** of total procedural billing  
>  **Imaging procedures are the primary revenue drivers** in healthcare.  
>  This may indicate **high demand or overreliance**, informing investment and cost strategies.


**🩺 Chronic Disease Management**


- **Hypertension:** 53.92% billed as **outpatient**  
> This suggests it is being **managed effectively without emergency care**.  
> Use this trend to improve outpatient care plans and reduce avoidable ER visits.



**🧭 Geographic Billing Patterns**

- **High Billing Cities:** London, Birmingham, Dublin  
- **Lower Billing Regions:** Glasgow and surrounding areas  
>  Billing varies significantly by region.  
>  Opportunity for **targeted investments** in lower-performing areas through:
> - Infrastructure enhancements
> - Community outreach programs

  <b>🔹  Billing Analysis: Key Insights 🔹</b>
</p>



 **1. Year-over-Year Billing Drop**
 
> There has been a significant 29.6% drop in total billing from 2024 to 2025. This decline may indicate underlying issues affecting overall revenue.

**2. Weekday vs. Weekend Billing**



> Billing decreased across both weekdays and weekends, with weekend billing experiencing a steeper decline. Possible drivers could include changes in customer behavior or operational inefficiencies.


**3. Departmental Decline**



> Every department experienced a significant billing decline, with Cardiology and Pediatrics hit the hardest. Potential causes may include patient volume drops or operational challenges.



**4. Monthly Billing Fluctuations**



> January’s spike may reflect a post-holiday backlog or rescheduled procedures from December. However, the overall yearly trend remains negative, signaling weaker demand in subsequent months.

**5. Weekday Billing Patterns**


> Weekday billing is generally more stable and efficient, while weekend billing—especially Sundays—underperforms.
